#Python Web Statistics

Small program that I created to brush up on my Python
and learn Python 3. It reads data from https://lpo.dt.navy.mil/
and finds out different statistical things about that data. It uses
SQLite as the backend database.

Things to do in further updates:
--Add a GUI so you don't have to read plain text from command line (considering tkinter)
--Add additional features and trends about the data pulled, so data is more meaningful and can be displayed through a GUI
